# Intro to Python - Fall 2016

This is an 8 week introductory class to Python that focuses on **financial applications**. Each class will be spent working through real life problems, learning how to code along the way.

The [Udacity Intro to Computer Science](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs101) course is used for supplementary learning.

The [Notes](../master/Notes) folder includes a powerpoint for [basic Python functionality](../master/Notes/Python_Basic.pptx) and a guide for [starting a new programming project](../master/Notes/Starting_a_Project.md).

The class will work on two projects that are stored in the [Code](../master/Code) folder. The first is a [web scraper](../master/Code/sp500_extractor) that extracts the S&P 500 component list from the [S&P 500 Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies) page, saving the table to a CSV file. The second project is another [web scraper](../master/Code/price_extractor) that pulls the historical stock prices from Yahoo Finance, and saves the values to a CSV file.

The final class activity is an independent project, where each student will build a program from idea to finished product.
